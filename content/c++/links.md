These are C++ links I like to read:

* [HackingCPP](https://hackingcpp.com/index.html): It has a lot of [cheet sheets](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/cheat_sheets.html) to algorithms and good explanations. Also good tutorials which are comprehensive with many examples
* [CPP Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines): C++ guidelines which is used by many companies and projects. Setting up the checker for the guideline is given in this [post]({{< ref "/c++/cpp_core_guidelines_checker_setup" >}}).
