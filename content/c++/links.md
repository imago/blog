These are **C++ links** I like to read:

* [HackingCPP](https://hackingcpp.com/index.html): It has a lot of [cheet sheets](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/cheat_sheets.html) to algorithms and good explanations. Also good tutorials which are comprehensive with many examples
* [CPP Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines): C++ guidelines which is used by many companies and projects. Setting up the checker for the guideline is given in this [post]({{< ref "/c++/cpp_core_guidelines_checker_setup" >}}).

Useful **links to Software Architecture** topics:
* [aim42](https://aim42.github.io/): Software Architecture method collection.
* [arc42](https://www.arc42.de/): Architecture documentation method which is useful for many projects.

Some **Software Architecture books** I like:
* [arc42 by Example: Software architecture documentation in practice](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07YXQSGD6): Software architecture documentation using arc42 method.
* [Effektive Softwarearchitekturen: Ein praktischer Leitfaden](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08F352FY7/): Easily written an understanable book about software architecture in practice
* [Basiswissen für Softwarearchitekten: Aus- und Weiterbildung nach iSAQB-Standard zum Certified Professional for Software Architecture – Foundation Level](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08DRHRZD6/): Basics for software architecture and preparation for iSAQB foundation level exam.
